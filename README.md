React app to display a list of all movies I've watched. Includes a search and filter by genre and year feature and utilizes The Movie Databse (TMDB) API to get the poster of movies added to the watched movies JSON file and display their info when clicked. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
